\title{
Visualization of associations between all pairs of variables. 
}
\description{
Uses the association array generated by \code{tap} to construct
an array of association diagrams (pie charts and scatterplots).
}
\usage{
agram(dataSet, amat, method, ranking, order, ...)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{dataSet}{
  the n x m data frame representing n samples of the m variables.
  }
  \item{amat}{
  a named precomputed association matrix for the data set 
  as returned by \code{\link{tap}}. The default is \code{NULL} which
  causes \code{agram} to call \code{tap} itself. 
  }
  \item{method}{
  the method to use for linear association as performed by \code{cor}, 
  one of \code{"pearson"}, \code{"spearman"}, \code{"kendall"}. The default
  is \code{"pearson"}.
  }
  \item{ranking}{
  a logical specifying whether or not to rank the data points before
  producing the scatter plots. The default is \code{FALSE}.
  }
  \item{order}{
  one of \code{FALSE} (the default for no re-grouping) or 
  \code{"PC"} (for principal components re-grouping)
  or \code{"OLO"} (for optimal leaf ordering)
  }
  \item{...}{
  passed on to graphics routines ...
  }
}
\details{
  Displays associations between all pairs of variables in a graphics array using
  pie-charts above the diagonal showing linear association in blue and non-linear
  association in red.
  
  Below the diagonal, scatter plots are shown and colored according to
  proportional non-linearity (see \code{nl3} returned by \code{\link{ma.nl}} ).
}
\value{
  Returns nothing.
